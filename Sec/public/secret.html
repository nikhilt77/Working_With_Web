    <li>Random Shit :: If a friend or a family member gets diagnosed with dementia or alzheimer, in the early stages try to find out
      what their
      favorite songs of all time are. In this way you would be able to create a playlist for them that could be of great
      benefit in the later stages of the disease.</li>
    <li>When a friend is upset, ask them one simple question before saying anything else: 'Do you want to talk about it
      or do
      you want to be distracted from it?'</li>
    <li>If you ever forget your WiFi password or you want to get your school WiFi password etc. Just type this command
      into the
      command line of a computer already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear</li>
